class Board

#this should be a blank array of cells each time
  currentState = [ - - - - - - - -  ]

  def initialize()

#this should allow the user to select a position on the board
  def selectPosition(index):
#I believe the || is a way to say "or" and since either human_player or computer_player can selectPosition both
their character choices should be valid
    currentState[index] = 'X'||'O'

  def getValidPositions()

  def printCurrentState()
 


Test for Board Class:

Check if current state of the board has a blank array of cells when created
Check if the position of human_player gets marked 'X' when they call selectPosition
Check that the valid positions are correct for the given state of the board
