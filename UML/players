        #in make_a_move I want to be able to call the board class
        and give player_1 the ability to check the current state of the
        board and be able to make sure the move selected is for an empty spot on 
        the array, then if it is I want otbe able to print an "X on the spot selected in this case (5)
        
        def make_a_move()
         board.get_valid_move
         board.selected_move(5)

    end
end

# Create variables that will call the actions that can be places in main.rb

b1 = board.new
p1 = Player.new(b1)
p1.make_a_move()

Tests for Player class

check if all attrributes work
check to make sure that make_a_move calls the board class and reccognizes where in the array the player has selected
check to make sure if Player selects a cell that already has been chosen it does not override the first move that was put there
