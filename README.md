## Who is Lightning

Lightning is the made up client I am building this for which is the alter ego of my OG mentor. He's bascially a crazy old drunk of a pirate who got into building apps. He is the second cousin of Jeff Bezos but he doesn't like to admit it cuz Bezos is a jerk who kinda looks like Sam Eagle the muppet....seriously look at Bezos and Same the Eagle pics side by side. They are basically twins!
## Who the heck is Cyril???
This app is to help with diversity and inclusion amongst our brethren from the sea, Sharks need to be entertained as well so they wont eat people.
We represent Sharks in our project management tools by creating the character of Cyril, the a hammer head shark who has prosthetic hands...cuz why not.
## Principles we work by

1. Empathy for the user

2. Always useable

3. Test driven

4. Clearly written

5. No fear!...not the clothing brand from the 90s
